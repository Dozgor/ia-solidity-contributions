# üß± Public Solidity Contributions ‚Äì Dozgor (IA-assisted Solidity Contributor)

Welcome to the summary of my public Solidity contributions.  
Each project was built as part of my Web3 developer journey, using an IA-assisted methodology to ensure rigor, clarity, and consistency.

## ‚úÖ Contribution 1: OpenZeppelin Contracts ‚Äì Invalid Beacon Test

- **PR**: [#5700 ‚Äì openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/pull/5700)
- **Date**: May 27, 2025

**Context**:  
Simulated an edge-case failure using an invalid beacon (`BadBeacon.sol`)  
Added a dedicated test in `BeaconProxy.test.js` to verify correct system behavior.

**Highlights**:
- Crafted a custom Solidity test contract
- Integrated seamlessly into a large test suite
- Resolved technical issues with Husky, Ethers, and local compilation
- Collaborated with the repo maintainers using IA-guided analysis

## ‚úÖ Contribution 2: SimpleVault ‚Äì Minimal Ether Vault Contract

- **Project**: [SimpleVault](./SimpleVault/README.md)
- **Date**: June 7, 2025

**Context**:  
Basic contract allowing a single owner to securely deposit and withdraw ETH.  
Used to demonstrate the correct usage of `msg.sender`, `msg.value`, `require`, and `transfer`.

**Highlights**:
- Minimal and clear code, tested in Remix
- `onlyOwner` modifier for secured withdrawals
- Public function to read contract balance
- Fully documented as a pedagogical base

## ‚úÖ Contribution 3: UserRegistry ‚Äì On-chain User Management

- **Project**: [UserRegistry](./user-registry/README.md)
- **Date**: May 30, 2025

**Context**:  
A contract allowing users to register themselves with a name, email, and timestamp.  
Useful for learning about mappings, structs, events, and input constraints.

**Highlights**:
- Mapping `address => User` with uniqueness checks
- Prevents double registration
- Emits events on registration
- Great for Web3 form/backend prototypes

## ‚úÖ Contribution 4: SimpleDAO ‚Äì Voting-Based DAO Prototype

- **Project**: [SimpleDAO](./Simple-DAO/README.md)
- **Date**: June 2, 2025

**Context**:  
A basic DAO structure where members can create proposals, vote, and trigger execution.  
Created to understand governance patterns and collective decision-making on-chain.

**Highlights**:
- Member-based voting system with proposal lifecycle
- Threshold and quorum logic
- Shows DAO patterns in a simplified, readable format

## ‚úÖ Contribution 5: MiniMultiSigWallet ‚Äì Lightweight Multisig Wallet

- **Project**: [MiniMultiSigWallet](./MiniMultiSigWallet/README.md)
- **Date**: June 4, 2025

**Context**:  
A minimal multi-signature wallet that requires multiple approvals to execute a transaction.  
Implemented and tested using Hardhat.

**Highlights**:
- Owners can submit, approve, and execute transactions
- Approval logic with threshold enforcement
- Uses nested mappings and structs
- Documented for reuse and audit training

## ‚úÖ Contribution 6: MyERC20Token ‚Äì Minimal ERC20 Token with Extensions

- **Project**: [MyERC20Token](./MyERC20Token/README.md)
- **Date**: May 29, 2025

**Context**:  
Custom ERC20 token based on OpenZeppelin‚Äôs implementation.  
Includes a `burn()` function and tested via Hardhat.

**Highlights**:
- Clean ERC20 base using OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Custom `burn(uint256)` function with `msg.sender` and `totalSupply` logic
- Unit tests covering mint, burn, and transfers
- Ready-to-fork and clearly documented

---

## üîú Coming Up

- Final deployment of a feature-complete ERC20 with `mint`, `burn`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`
- Public contributions in gas optimization and security audits
- Solidity teaching materials (tested contracts, use-cases, common pitfalls)
